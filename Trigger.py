Trigger.py
Fast-path triggers (no LLM call) cover ~80% of cases:
  - Direct address ("sam") → YES immediately
  - Trivial fillers → NO immediately
  - Incomplete endings → wait
  - Memory recall keywords → YES immediately
  - Question ending "?" → YES immediately
  - 2+ PM keywords → YES immediately
  - Recent follow-up (< 3s) → YES immediately
  - Cooldown gate → NO
  - Ambiguous phrases → LLM decision (~200-700ms)

Your job is to decide whether YOU should speak next.

Context:

Relevant past memory:

Latest message from {speaker}: "{text}"

Say YES if:
- The message is directed at you explicitly or implicitly
- It is a question expecting your input
- It refers to something discussed earlier
- It feels like a follow-up to something you said
- The speaker seems to be waiting for your response
- Someone greets the group — greet back

Say NO if:
- The message is clearly directed to someone else by name
- Two other people are talking to each other
- It is just filler, acknowledgment, or side chatter
- The speaker is clearly mid-sentence (ends with "and", "so", "but", "the")

Reply ONLY with YES or NO.
